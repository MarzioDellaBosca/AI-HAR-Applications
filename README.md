# Multivariate Time Series Activity Classification

This project focuses on **classification of human activities** using features extracted from **multivariate time series data**, typically from motion sensors embedded in mobile phones, such as:
- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope

The goal is to aggregate compatible datasets, extract a consistent set of features, and develop models (including neural networks) for robust activity classification.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The datasets used in this project include:

- **WISDM**
- **MotionSense**
- **Heterogeneity Activity Recognition**
- **MobiAct**

Each dataset has its own directory containing the respective raw or preprocessed data files.

---

## üß† Feature Extraction

There is a dedicated **Jupyter Notebook** for feature extraction for each dataset:
- `MOBY_feature_extractor.ipynb`
- `WISDM_feature_extractor.ipynb`
- `HHAR_feature_extractor.ipynb`
- `MOTION_feature_extractor.ipynb`

Each notebook:
- Loads the raw dataset
- Preprocesses the multivariate signals
- Extracts statistical, temporal, or frequency-domain features (e.g., using **CATCH22**, **TSFEL**, etc.)

## ü§ñ Modeling & Experiments

The notebook `ProgettoApplicazioniIA.ipynb` handles:
- Aggregation of feature sets from multiple datasets (where possible)
- Dataset balancing and preprocessing
- Implementation of various **neural network architectures**
- Evaluation of performance on consistent activity labels across datasets

This stage allows experimentation with model generalization across heterogeneous data sources.

## üìÇ Data Files

All dataset files are stored in their respective directories (e.g., `./WISDM/`, `./MotionSense/`, etc.).  
These files are **not tracked by Git**, as specified in the `.gitignore`, due to GitHub‚Äôs storage and upload size limitations.
